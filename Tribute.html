<b>ABOUT THE BOOK</b> <br>
CAN’T HURT ME, David Goggins’ smash hit memoir, demonstrated how much untapped ability 
we have, but was merely an introduction to the power of the mind. In NEVER FINISHED, 
Goggins takes you inside his Mental Lab, where he developed the philosophy, psychology 
and strategies that enabled him to learn that what he thought was his limit was only his
 beginning and that the quest for greatness is unending. The stories and lessons in this
  raw, revealing, unflinching memoir, offer the reader a blueprint they can use to climb 
  from the bottom of the barrel into a whole new stratosphere that once seemed unattainable.
   Whether you feel off-course in life, are looking to maximize your potential or drain your
soul to break through your so-called glass ceiling, this is the only book you will ever need.
